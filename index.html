        </ul>
        <p>Everyone has their own hobby. I have a few too, including programming. Since I started this path for my life coding has been my favorite thing to do. I also love Fashion. Going out and shopping makes me feel so good. And last but not least is Makeup. Since I was younger I loved to do makeup for myself and everyone who asked me for. </p>
